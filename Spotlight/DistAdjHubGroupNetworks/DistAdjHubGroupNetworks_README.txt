The scripts in this folder are the same as SpotlightGroupNetworksWashU.m except they use 1-Pearson Correlation and 1-Spearman Correlation distance metrics. For the sake of record keeping these were made into separate scripts but they can be easily combined into a single script with a distance metric option.
